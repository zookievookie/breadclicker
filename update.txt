2020-10-26 at 12:00am CST: BC Update v1.9
	Hello all BC fans! This update attempts to end the messy transition from development platforms. 

	Bread Clicker is now 100% in-browser, featuring "homemade" sprites and textures, and is light and non-intensive on your browsing engine. 

	Your game is always saved within your browser, so the only way to lose your data is run any browser cleaner, cookie-blocker, or manually clearing cookies.

	It has been over 18 months since the origins of this game - and it's finally time for an overhaul. 

	With this update, we bring over 25 new breads, dozens of spreads, and over 40 new upgrades for you to explore. 

	Additionally, achievements were added to spice up gameplay and provide incentive for doing tasks.

	To wrap things up, we added the stats menu so you can track your progress.
	



	
Future update:

Along with brand new menu items, there's a whole new side of Bread Clicker for you to explore! 

After purchasing your first bakery, you have to fill orders and you will get certain bonuses in return! 

However, by investing in a whole crew of bakers per restaurant, all you have to do is keep an eye on all of the stores you own.
