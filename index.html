				  <p class="B3">by BC Support - March 12, 2020</p>
				  <p class="B4">
				    It has been nearly a year of Bread Clicker. In the first few months, there
				    were nearly daily updates to the game, but around May we slowed down on the
				    rate of the updates to zero. In late fall of 2019, our team brought back
				    the game and tried to make Bread Clicker a much better game. Since October,
				    we have brought dozens of new concepts and additions to the game that made
				    our game so much more enjoyable to play. However, February saw no updates.
				    We plan to make March, the birth month of this game, as active as we can
				    with updates. Get excited for the future of Bread Clicker!
				  </p></div>

			      The original bread of Bread Clicker! White bread is the right bread,

			      adventurous. In the shape of a hemisphere. Line down the middle for
			      your spreads, like butter. Gives you <span>2 DPC</span> and <span>

			      This tasty treat originates back to March 26, 2019 when it was added
			      along with the DPS counter and World Record display in update 0.1.2.5.
			      "Not to be confused for Hole Wheat, Whole Heat, or Hole Heat." Definitely
			      delicious and healthy. Full of your necessary calories, carbs, and fiber
			      to get you through the struggles life. Gives you <span>3 DPC</span>
			      and <span>+0.4 DPS</span>. Costs <span>250 dough</span>.

			      A fine addition to the bread basket, sourdough was released on April
			      3, 2019 in update 0.4. "It's not even tart." Not fantastically sour,
			      but whoever made the crosses on top gets their 5-star review from me.
			      Gives you <span>4 DPC</span> and <span>+0.5 DPS</span>. Costs <span>500

			      The longest bread currently available. It was released on April 16,
			      2019 in update 0.8. "HONHONHON OUI OUI BAGUETTE" French delicacy. It

			      At the full release of Bread Clicker 1.0 on April 27, 2019, the classic
			      fruity bread, banana bread, was added to the game. "A fan favorite,
			      but not a flan favorite" Butter it, don't bother toasting it! This
			      fruity delight will set you ahead of the game with its stats. It will
			      set you back with its price though! (Tax not included) Gives you <span>

			      The breads keep getting more diverse, but cornbread, added on October
			      29, 2019 in update 1.3.7, takes it to a new level. "Can also be a muffin."
			      Made from corn, and it is delicious with as much butter as you can
			      fit onto it. Makes you feel poor though. Gives you <span>12 DPC</span>
			      and <span>+2 DPS</span>. Costs <span>50000 dough</span>.

			      A super tasty and original classic that you just can't pass up on!
			      This was the first spread that was placed into the game on April 2,
			      2019 in update 0.1.4. "It is butter. You butter believe it!" Straight
			      from the farm, slightly salted. A very affordable purchase from the
