            The original bread of Bread Clicker! White bread is the right bread,

            A fine addition to the bread basket, sourdough was released on April
            3, 2019 in update 0.4. "It's not even tart." Not fantastically sour,

            At the full release of Bread Clicker 1.0 on April 27, 2019, the classic
            fruity bread, banana bread, was added to the game. "A fan favorite,
            but not a flan favorite" Butter it, don't bother toasting it! This

            set you back with its price though! (Tax not included) Gives you <span>
            8 DPC</span> and <span>+2 DPS</span>. Costs <span>10000 dough</span>.

            The breads keep getting more diverse, but cornbread, added on October
            29, 2019 in update 1.3.7, takes it to a new level. "Can also be a muffin."
            Made from corn, and it is delicious with as much butter as you can
            fit onto it. Makes you feel poor though. Gives you <span>12 DPC</span>

            2019 in update 0.1.4. "It is butter. You butter believe it!" Straight
            from the farm, slightly salted. A very affordable purchase from the

            A fruity addition to the game, strawberry jam was the second spread
            first available on April 3, 2019 in update 0.4. "It's not jelly, it's 
            JAM! *Music plays*" Sweet and jammy, just the way everyone likes it.

            If you are incapable of making lactase, this spread is perfect for you!
            Margarine, the substitute for butter, was added on April 17, 2019 
            in update 0.8.2. "WOW! I can't believe it! IT'S MARGARINE" It's not 
            real butter. It is growth-stunting chemicals that will give you digestion 
            problems and chronic but mild headaches. Gives you <span>2% bonus on DPS</span>.

          <h3 class="slt">
            The bee is a rather important thing in our food chain, and they produce
            some of the best natural sugars of all insects. Honey was added on November
            19, 2019 in update 1.5.3. What can I say? It's honey." It's not the bee's 
            knees. But hey, it doesn't expire! Don't give it to your newborn, it will 
            suffocate. Gives you <span>3% bonus on DPS</span>. Costs <span>50000 dough</span>.
